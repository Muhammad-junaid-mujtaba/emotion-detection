Emotion Detection from Images (Python)
This project is an AI-powered system for real-time emotion detection from facial images. Using deep learning techniques, it analyzes facial expressions from uploaded images and predicts the underlying emotion with approximately 90% accuracy.

🎯 Project Overview
The Emotion Detection system helps recognize human emotions from facial images by leveraging computer vision and a trained deep learning model.

✅ Features
📸 Image-Based Emotion Detection
Upload a facial image and get the predicted emotion.

🧠 High Accuracy (~90%)
The model is trained on a large facial emotion dataset and achieves ~90% accuracy on real-world images.

⚡ Real-Time Prediction
Predictions are generated instantly after image upload.

🧾 Clean Python Codebase
Simple, modular design using OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.

🧠 Emotions Detected
Happy

Sad

Angry

Fear

Surprise

Neutral

Disgust
